Chalet St Moritz

Morzine
Morzine is a thriving Alpine village set deep in the Chablais mountain range, between Lake Geneva and Mont Blanc, by the France-Switzerland border. 
It has grown over the years to become a charming ski resort in winter.

The biggest winter festival is the Rock des Pistes week in March, where live bands play up on the pistes.
The area offers riders some of the worldâ€™s best biking terrain, with around 380km of marked trails with varying degrees of technical skill required.
