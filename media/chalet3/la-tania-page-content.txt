Chalet Carmen

La Tania
One of France's best kept skiing secrets, La Tania lies between Courchevel and Meribel in the extensive Three Valleys ski area. Purpose-built in 1992 for the Winter Olympics, this pretty little resort has been sympathetically constructed using natural materials. A free bus service links La Tania with Courchevel 1850 during the day, although skiers will prefer to take the gondola straight up to the ski area.

A quieter alternative to the better-known resorts in the Three Valleys that’s ideal for families.
A perfect location between the resorts of Courchevel and Meribel, with Ski-in, ski-out accommodation close to all the resort’s bars, restaurants and shops.
